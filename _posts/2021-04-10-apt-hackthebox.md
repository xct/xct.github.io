title: APT @ HackTheBox
---

APT is a 50-point machine on HackTheBox which involves getting the IPv6 Address via MS-RPC, credential spraying, and reading the boxes registry remotely. For root, we force authentication of the boxâ€™s machine account to our box, capture it with responder, crack it, and then use secretsdump to obtain the administrator hash.
